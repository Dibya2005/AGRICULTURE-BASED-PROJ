# Crop Recommendation System (ML + Flask Web App)
Description:
Built an intelligent crop recommendation system that predicts the most suitable crop to grow based on key soil and climate parameters. The system uses a Random Forest model trained on real agricultural datasets, and is deployed using a Flask web application with a clean, responsive UI.

ðŸ”§ Tools & Technologies:

Python, scikit-learn (Random Forest)

Flask (backend & deployment)

HTML, CSS (responsive frontend)

NumPy, Pandas, Joblib

Model tuning with GridSearchCV

ðŸ“Œ Features:

User inputs: Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, Temperature, Humidity, pH, Rainfall

Real-time crop prediction based on trained ML model

Fully functional web interface with input validation

Deployed locally using Flask; can be extended to cloud platforms

ðŸ’¡ Outcome:
Improves decision-making for farmers by suggesting the best crop based on soil and environmental factors. Helps promote data-driven farming and boost productivity.
